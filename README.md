## Overview

**loggr.io is made up of the following three components**

* H5VZR (AngularJS)
* API (LoopBack)
* RASPI (Python)

**loggr.io is currently still in development.**

We're progressing quickly, but the documentation still needs filling in, and there are a few rough edges.  The 1.0 release is planned to arrive in the next few months.
