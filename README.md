## Overview

**loggr.io is made up of the following three components**

* [H5VZR](https://github.com/loggrio/loggr-h5vzr) (AngularJS)
* [API](https://github.com/loggrio/loggr-api) (Express / LoopBack)
* [RASPI](https://github.com/loggrio/loggr-unit-raspberry) (Python)

**loggr.io is currently still in development.**

We're progressing quickly, but the documentation still needs filling in, and there are a few rough edges.  The 1.0 release is planned to arrive in the next few months.
